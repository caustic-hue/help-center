# Creating And Hosting a Discord Bot Using Discord.js
### Creating a Bot
First, simply go to [Discord's Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and login.Then, click on "New Application" in the top right corner of the screen, give it a name and click on "Create". After that, click on bot on the side menu, press add bot and confirm it.
You've sucessfully created the bot account!

## Coding a Bot
To code your bot and to do the following steps you must have basic knowledge of NodeJS and a code editor installed on your PC such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), but you can use one of your liking.

### Prepare Everything
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest version) on your local machine;
* Create a folder for your bot and open the terminal in there;
* Create a new file called index.js in the folder. This will be the main bot file;
* Create a `package.json` file by typing `npm init -y` in the terminal, in that folder;
* Type `npm install discord.js`in the terminal, in the same folder, and wait for it to install;

### Essential Coding

Once discord.js is fully installed, open the index.js file and type the following:
```
const Discord = require('discord.js')
const client = new Discord.Client()
```

We have defined the client. Now we will make an event for when the bot is ready. This will print a message in the console when the bot is ready to be used:

```
client.once('ready', () =>{
console.log ('Bot Is Online');
});
```

Now, we will make a simple command

```
 client.on("message", async message => {
 if (message.content === '!ping') {
     message.channel.send('Pong!')
 }
 });
```

We have made a command. Now let's specify to the script our bot TOKEN. This will tell it what account to use.

To get the TOKEN, go to [discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and in your application, click on Bot, and copy the token
The Token is like a password, so don't share it with anyone!

`client.run('Your Super Secret Token')`

## Hosting The Bot

To host your bot in our service, you need a server. To create one, follow [this article](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/getting-started/#creating-a-server). Head over to the [Game Panel](https://panel.falixnodes.net), log in and select the server you've just created. Once you're there, go to your server's file manager. A "button" for it can be found on the top bar. Now, simply upload your 3 bot files (index.js, package.json, package-lock.json) to the main path. Wait for the upload to be complete and navigate back to your server's console, then start your server. You'll be shown a bunch of options including Bot hosting. Since we're hosting a Discord bot, type `1` and press enter. You'll be shown a new menu with a bunch of new options. This is a NodeJS Discord bot guide, so we're going to choose option `1`, to start a NodeJS server, then choose the NodeJS version (If you downloaded the latest NodeJS version (16.2.0 at the moment) or you're running a version that is not listed there, choose `custom`, and type the version you want). Wait for it to download and install. Your server should've crashed with an error. Wait for it to start again. Now, we're going to install discord.js. For that, you'll need to choose option `7`, to install the packages from the package.json file, then choose the NodeJS version. Once the installation process of discord.js has finished, start a NodeJS server, option 1, type the name of bot your main file, in our case, `index.js`, and choose the NodeJS version.
