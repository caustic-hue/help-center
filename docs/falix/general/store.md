## Store
We have a store in which you can buy resources like ram, CPU cores, disk, etc using Falixcoins.

## How to access the store
You would first need to log in at [https://client.falix.gg](https://client.falix.gg) and then on the sidebar you will see a store option, click on it then you will be redirected to the store.

## How to use the store
After getting redirected to the store website you will see the price of the item and an interface to change the amount of units of the item you will like to buy. After selecting the right unit of the item click to buy, you should get coins deducted and the item you purchased increased.
